  * Improvements to documentation (William King, Tomas Doran)

0.13  Sat, 20 Mar 2010 12:23:14 +0100
  * Make the reader methods for _action_roles and _action_role_args not be
    context-sensitive and always return a plain list.

0.12  Sat, 18 Jul 2009 00:41:15 +0100
  * More correct method for getting the app class. Can't test this yet,
    as the canonical example ($self being an anon class) doesn't work in
    core Catalyst yet :(
  * Do not need an _action_role_prefix method, so that in future it is easier to
    pull the code out into a role.
  * Add tests for compatibility when used with Action::REST

0.11  Sun, 24 May 2009 17:57:15 +0200

0.07  Wed, 01 Apr 2009 12:18:43 -0700

0.06  Wed, 01 Apr 2009 16:29:37 +0200
  * Don't depend on parent.pm for the tests.

0.04_01  Sun, 29 Mar 2009 13:28:24 +0200

    backward-compat now.
